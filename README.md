# Automation Vision Suite

An **OpenCV + Python–based industrial vision framework** for **robotics and automation systems**.  
This project explores replacing proprietary vision systems with a **custom, flexible, and cost-effective solution**, integrated directly with **PLCs and industrial robots**.

> ⚠️ **Project Status:** Partially developed & discontinued  
> Development was discontinued due to organizational decisions during previous employment.  
> This repository contains **working demos and proof-of-concept implementations**.
